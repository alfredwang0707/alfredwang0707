### Hey there!   this is Al

**Software Engineer**
Base in NYC, from Taiwan

I took my first steps into Web Development, designing websites back in the Xanga days copying and paste snow effects in the background feeling awesome. Years later I begin to find out more about what's happening under the hood.

I like my code functional and structured and continue to dig deeper into more tools and technologies. Utilizing different libraries and reading their docs takes up most of my time during projects.
